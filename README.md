## About Scrimba
The Frontend Developer Career Path aims to teach you everything you need to become a Junior Developer, or you could take a deep-dive with one of our advanced courses ðŸš€. Scrimba was the bootcamp where the project idea came from. I modified the CSS and created my own data file of Corgi memes for the project.
